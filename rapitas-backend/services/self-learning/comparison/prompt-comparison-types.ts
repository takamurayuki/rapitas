 * ("shadow run") system: same model, same budget, same sample tasks, run
 * under both the current and candidate prompt with knowledge on/off, so a
 * PromptEvolution candidate's success-rate/cost/duration delta and internal
 * failure causes can be recorded before it is staged to real tasks. Kept
 * dependency-free — same policy as experiment-types.ts — so the pure module
 * (prompt-comparison-metrics) and the I/O module (prompt-comparison-store /
 * prompt-comparison-runner) never form cycles.
