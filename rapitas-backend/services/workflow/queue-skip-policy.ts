 *  - the task is already blocked and awaiting a human
 *  - the task is parked on a question and needs an answer
 *  - the task opted out of phase-by-phase execution entirely
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-23: retrying these burned every task's three retries within
 * seconds and, worse, replaced the recorded failure reason with
 * 「タスクはブロック中のため自動実行をスキップしました」 — so tasks 602 and 647
 * showed a tautology ("blocked because blocked") instead of the
 * verify_validation_failed that actually stopped them. 105 of the window's
 * retries came from the awaiting_question variant alone.
