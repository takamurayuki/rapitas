/**
 * Runs the post-save automation for a verify.md that just reached `verify_done`.
 *
 * The task's `workflowStatus` is already `verify_done` in the DB by the time
 * this is called, so the WorkflowRunner's verify-settle wait can observe it
 * from its very first poll. Task 658 (task 660): only the commit/PR stage was
 * registered in-flight, so the gate + LLM jury that precede it (jurors time
 * out at 120s each) ran with the registry empty, the runner's 60s window
 * expired at 63s and a task whose PR #458 landed 3.5 minutes later was parked
 * as blocked. Registering the whole sequence here, BEFORE the first await,
 * closes that gap: there is no longer any moment between the DB write and the
 * final outcome in which the automation is running but unregistered.
 *
 * Every early exit inside the three stages (gate blocked, jury FAIL bounce,
 * recovery exhausted) is a normal `return` from those functions, so the
 * wrapped Promise settles and the registry entry is released on all of them.
 *
 * @param params - taskId / fileType / newStatus after the status transition / saved verify.md content / 入力一式
 * @returns The completion outcome (pass-through when the save was not a passing verify)
