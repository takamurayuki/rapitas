/**
 * Best-effort auto re-trigger after an intake question is answered.
 *
 * This pause never had a live agent process to resume (see
 * handleAnswerWorkflowQuestion's doc comment) — without this, a manually
 * executed task (auto-run disabled for its theme) just sat at
 * workflowStatus='draft' forever, needing the user to notice and click
 * "実行" again themselves. That silently contradicted the frontend's own
 * phase-completion message, which always claims "次のフェーズへ自動で進みます"
 * for the researcher phase regardless of whether it ended in a question.
 *
 * Reuses the SAME agent config the task's last execution used (falls back to
 * the execute route's own default-agent resolution when none is found).
 * Never throws — errors are logged and swallowed so a failed auto re-run
 * cannot fail the caller's own response; a theme with auto-run currently
 * active will reject this with 409 (harmless — the scheduler already owns
 * that task).

/**
 * Best-effort re-dispatch nudge after an implementation-phase question is
 * resolved (task 830).
 *
 * `applyResumeFromQuestionAnswer` only flips DB columns (workflowStatus, and
 * — via its own #804 backstop — task.status when it was 'todo'). Neither
 * actually makes the theme scheduler pick the task back up:
 * `ThemeAutoRun.currentTaskId` is left untouched, so if it was cleared (e.g.
 * a theme stop mid-question via `stopThemeExecutionImpl`/`finalizeStop`, then
 * re-armed by the idle-timer's manual-task-rearm path) the task sits as a
 * normal backlog item with no `WorkflowQueueItem` and no scheduler claim on
 * it — reproducing exactly the `status='todo'` × advanced `workflowStatus`
 * shape task 830 investigated, for however long it takes the theme to happen
 * to reselect it (or never, if another task keeps winning selection).
 *
 * Only acts when it is PROVABLY SAFE — the theme is enabled+running AND
 * either has no current task or is already tracking this exact task. It
 * NEVER reassigns a theme that is mid-flight on a DIFFERENT task: doing so
 * would let two agents run concurrently for the same theme (the "multiple
 * agents launched before others finished" class of bug guarded against
 * elsewhere in the auto-run scheduler). When the theme is genuinely busy
 * elsewhere, this task legitimately waits its turn — normal selection picks
 * it up once the current task frees the theme.
 *
 * `setCurrentTask` is only called AFTER `enqueue` has actually succeeded —
 * claiming the theme's `currentTaskId` for a task with no matching
 * `WorkflowQueueItem` would recreate the exact desync this nudge exists to
 * close, just with an extra, misleading "claimed" signal on top.
 *
 * Never throws — errors are logged and swallowed so a failed nudge cannot
 * fail the caller's own response; the task's own state was already durably
 * updated by the caller before this runs.
